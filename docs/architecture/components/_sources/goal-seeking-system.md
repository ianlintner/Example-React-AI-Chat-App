#### 2. AgentService (`agentService.ts`)

Enhanced agent service with goal-seeking integration.

**Key Methods:**

- `processMessageWithGoalSeeking()`: Processes messages with goal awareness
- `executeProactiveAction()`: Executes system-generated actions
- `getUserGoalState()`: Retrieves user's current goal state

#### 3. Socket Integration (`socketHandlers.ts`)

Real-time communication with proactive message delivery.

**New Events:**

- `proactive_message`: Delivers system-initiated messages
- `proactive_error`: Handles proactive action failures

## User States

### Current State Types

- `on_hold`: User is waiting for support
- `waiting_for_help`: User has a specific problem to solve
- `active_conversation`: User is actively engaged
- `idle`: User is present but not actively communicating

### Entertainment Preferences

- `jokes`: Prefers humor and dad jokes
- `trivia`: Enjoys facts and educational content

- User state is `on_hold`
- Engagement level < 0.6
- User mentions waiting, queue, or hold

**Success Criteria:**

- User responds positively to entertainment
- Engagement level > 0.7
- User remains in conversation

**Example Actions:**

```typescript
{
  type: 'proactive_message',
  agentType: 'dad_joke',
  message: "Time for a dad joke to brighten your wait!",
  timing: 'immediate'
}
```

### 2. Technical Support Goals

**Purpose**: Provide effective technical assistance

**Activation Triggers:**

- User state is `waiting_for_help`
- Technical context is detected
- User mentions code, error, bug, programming

**Success Criteria:**

- User problem is resolved
- Technical accuracy is maintained
- User satisfaction > 0.8

**Example Actions:**

```typescript
{
  type: 'technical_check',
  agentType: 'technical',
  message: "I'm here to help with your technical question. What specific issue can I assist you with?",
  timing: 'immediate'
}
```

### 3. Engagement Goals

**Purpose**: Maintain user engagement and prevent abandonment

**Activation Triggers:**

- Engagement level < 0.5
- Time since last interaction > 30 seconds
- User gives short responses

**Success Criteria:**

- User continues conversation
- Response time < 5 minutes
- User asks follow-up questions

**Example Actions:**

```typescript
{
  type: 'entertainment_offer',
  agentType: 'general',
  message: "Would you like me to entertain you with a joke, share some trivia, or help with a technical question?",
  timing: 'delayed',
  delayMs: 30000
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Message Processing Flow

1. **User Message Received**
   - Initialize user in goal-seeking system
   - Update user state based on message content
   - Activate relevant goals

2. **Agent Selection**
   - Process message with appropriate agent
   - Consider goal priorities and user preferences
   - Generate response with confidence scoring

3. **Goal Progress Update**
   - Analyze user response for satisfaction indicators
   - Update goal progress and user metrics
   - Adjust engagement and satisfaction levels

4. **Proactive Action Generation**
   - Generate actions based on active goals
   - Prioritize by goal importance and user needs
   - Schedule immediate or delayed execution

### Proactive Action Execution

```typescript
const executeProactiveAction = async (action: GoalAction, conversation: Conversation, socket: any, io: Server) => {
  // Execute action using agent service
  const response = await agentService.executeProactiveAction(userId, action, conversation.messages);

  // Create proactive message
  const proactiveMessage: Message = {
    // ... message properties
    isProactive: true, // Mark as system-initiated
  };

  // Emit to conversation
  io.to(conversationId).emit('proactive_message', {
    message: proactiveMessage,
    actionType: action.type,
    agentUsed: response.agentUsed,
  });
};
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: User Waiting for Support

```
User: "I'm waiting for support"
System: Activates entertainment goal
Agent: "I noticed you might be waiting - how about a dad joke to pass the time?"
Proactive Action: Offers entertainment options after 30 seconds
```

### Example 2: Technical Question

```
User: "I have a JavaScript error in my code"
System: Activates technical support goal
Agent: "I can help you with that JavaScript error. Can you share the error message?"
Proactive Action: Follows up if user doesn't respond within 2 minutes
```

### Example 3: Low Engagement

```
System: Detects user giving short responses
Goal: Engagement goal activates
Proactive Action: "Is there anything specific I can help you with today?"
```

## Frontend Integration
