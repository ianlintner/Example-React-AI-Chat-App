# Demo Portfolio - AI + Modern Web Engineering Patterns (Documentation Index)

Welcome to the documentation for a demo portfolio project that showcases contemporary AI and modern web engineering patterns. This suite is designed for hands‑on demos, interviews, workshops, and code reviews, emphasizing patterns, tradeoffs, and implementation details rather than product completeness.

## 📚 Documentation Overview

This documentation is organized to help you demo, explain, and evaluate key patterns quickly: multi‑agent orchestration, goal‑seeking loops, RAG, validation, and observability from metrics to traces.

Demo essentials:

- Start with the Main README for quick demo setup and a 10‑minute walkthrough.
- Open Grafana and Jaeger while interacting to visualize flows and latencies.
- Use the Architecture Guide to narrate design tradeoffs during a demo.
