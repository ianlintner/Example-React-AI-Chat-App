# Observability and Monitoring System

## Overview

Our AI Goal-Seeking Chat System includes comprehensive observability and monitoring capabilities to track system performance, user interactions, agent behavior, and goal-seeking effectiveness. This document outlines the monitoring architecture, metrics, tracing, and alerting systems.

## Architecture

### OpenTelemetry Integration

The system uses OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, providing insights into:

- Conversation flows and latency
- Agent selection and performance
- Goal-seeking system effectiveness
- Validation pipeline execution
- Proactive action triggering

### Key Components

1. **Tracing Infrastructure**
   - OpenTelemetry SDK with Jaeger exporter
   - Custom span creation for conversations, agents, and goal-seeking
   - Detailed event logging with contextual attributes

2. **Metrics Collection**
   - Real-time performance metrics
   - User engagement tracking
   - Agent effectiveness measurements
   - Goal achievement analytics

3. **Validation Monitoring**
   - Response quality tracking
   - Agent confidence scoring
   - Validation issue detection

## Tracing Structure

### Conversation Spans

Each user interaction creates a conversation span that tracks:

```
conversation.stream_chat
├── chat_request_received
├── goal_seeking.process
│   ├── goal_seeking_started
│   └── goal_seeking_completed
├── proactive_actions_started
└── conversation_completed
```

**Attributes Tracked:**

- `conversation.id` - Unique conversation identifier
- `user.socket_id` - User session identifier
- `message.length` - Message character count
- `agent.forced` - Whether specific agent was requested
- `agent.selected` - Which agent was chosen
- `agent.confidence` - Agent's confidence score
- `response.length` - Response character count
- `proactive_actions.count` - Number of proactive actions triggered
- `user.state` - Current user state (on_hold, active, etc.)
- `user.engagement` - User engagement level (0-1)
- `user.satisfaction` - User satisfaction level (0-1)

### Goal-Seeking Spans

Goal-seeking operations create detailed spans tracking:

```
goal_seeking.process
├── goal_seeking_started
├── agent_classification
├── context_analysis
├── goal_evaluation
├── action_planning
└── goal_seeking_completed
```

**Attributes Tracked:**

- `goal_seeking.operation` - Type of goal-seeking operation
- `user.state` - Current user state
- `user.engagement` - Engagement level
- `user.satisfaction` - Satisfaction level
- `goals.active` - List of active goals
- `context.analysis` - Context analysis results
- `decision.reasoning` - Goal-seeking decision reasoning

### Agent Spans

Individual agent operations create spans for:

```
agent.{agentType}.{operation}
├── agent_invoked
├── context_processing
├── llm_request
├── response_generation
└── agent_completed
```

**Attributes Tracked:**

- `agent.type` - Agent type (entertainment, technical, conversational)
- `agent.operation` - Operation type (process_message, generate_proactive)
- `agent.confidence` - Confidence score
- `llm.model` - LLM model used
- `llm.tokens_used` - Token consumption
- `response.quality` - Response quality metrics

### Validation Spans

Response validation creates monitoring spans:

```
validation.validate_response
├── validation_started
├── quality_check
├── relevance_analysis
├── safety_verification
└── validation_completed
```
