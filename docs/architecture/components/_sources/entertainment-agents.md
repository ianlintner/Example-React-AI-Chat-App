## RAG Integration

### Content Database Structure

Each entertainment agent leverages the RAG system for consistent, high-quality content:

```typescript
// Example content items
{
  id: 'joke_007',
  type: 'joke',
  content: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!",
  category: 'tech_joke',
  tags: ['programming', 'tech', 'dark mode', 'bugs', 'pun'],
  rating: 5
},
{
  id: 'trivia_001',
  type: 'trivia',
  content: "Did you know that octopuses have three hearts and blue blood?",
  category: 'animals',
  tags: ['octopus', 'hearts', 'blood', 'marine', 'biology'],
  rating: 5
},
{
  id: 'gif_001',
  type: 'gif',
  content: 'https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7abKhOpu0NwenH3O/giphy.gif',
  category: 'funny',
  tags: ['funny', 'laugh', 'comedy', 'silly', 'animated'],
  rating: 4,
  metadata: {
    description: 'Funny laughing reaction',
    alt: 'Person laughing hysterically'
  }
}
```

### Smart Content Selection

The system uses intelligent search algorithms to match content to user requests:

1. **Context Analysis** - Analyzes user message for intent and mood
2. **Relevance Scoring** - Ranks content by relevance to user request
3. **Quality Filtering** - Prioritizes highly-rated content (4-5 stars)
4. **Fallback Strategy** - Provides random quality content if no perfect match
5. **Variety Ensuring** - Avoids repetition through smart selection

## System Integration
