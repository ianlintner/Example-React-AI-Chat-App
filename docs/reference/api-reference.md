# API Reference

This project generates API documentation directly from code using swagger-jsdoc + swagger-ui-express. Use the live endpoints while the backend is running:

- Interactive Swagger UI: http://localhost:5001/docs
- OpenAPI JSON: http://localhost:5001/docs/json

Notes:

- The spec is built from JSDoc annotations in backend/src/routes/\*_/_.ts and backend/src/index.ts.
- Health checks are exposed at /health and /api/health.
- Core tags include: chat, conversations, reactions, validation, test-bench, queue, health.

If you need a static artifact, you can save the JSON from /docs/json and distribute it, or convert it to YAML with your preferred tooling.
